# Population Density

The Population Density Heatmap shows **how many people live in an area** on a hexagonal grid. It helps to understand which parts of a city are more and which are less densely populated.

<span style={{color: "#FF0000"}}>TODO: @EPajares & @majkshkurti - is "Population density" still the right term? I think it shows population numbers instead of densities.</span> 

## 1. Explanation

The **Population Density Heatmap** serves as an overview on the population densities, representing the demand side of the accessibility analysis. The higher the population density in an area, the higher also the **demand for amenities and services**.

The heatmap is visualized on a hexagonal grid. Per grid cell, the population numbers are shown by the use of different shades of red. The darker the colour, the higher the population density.

## 2. Which planning questions can be answered? 

Among others, the population density heatmap can be used to answer the following planning questions:
- Where are highly populated areas?
- Which areas have low population densities? 
- How does population density vary in a given study area?

## 3. How to use the indicator?

### Step-by-step guideline

1. Go into the tab ``INDICATORS`` and activate the ``Population Density`` heatmap. The resulting heatmap shows areas with <i>no population</i> in white, areas with <i>low population density</i> in <span style={{color: "#e8aa9b"}}>light red</span> and areas with <i>high population density</i> in <span style={{color: "#b03336"}}>dark red</span>.

2. To further understand, where the population density values come from, it is helpful to activate the ``Aerial Image`` background map.

3. In this example, we can see that one of the white areas has no population as it is an industrial area, while the large <span style={{color: "#b03336"}}>dark red</span> area is the city centre with high population densities.

## 4. Technical details
### Calculation

<span style={{color: "#FF0000"}}>TODO: @EPajares explain how the population densities / numbers are calculated. I think it depends a lot on the study area and the locally available data. Is it possible to still summarize the approach? </span> 

### Visualization 

The population density heatmap is visualized using a **hexagonal grid** with an edge length of approximately 174 m per cell.
