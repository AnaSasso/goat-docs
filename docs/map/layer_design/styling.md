# Styling 

By using **smart mapping** options, GOAT allows you experiment with many styling options. The style suggestions you get when using the <code>Layer Design</code> option depend on the **type of data** you have. You can change the look of your layer and see the changes instantly on the map once you've decided how you want to present it - for example, using circles or colors to indicate POIs. GOAT allows you to adjust visual aspects such as **strokes**, **opacity** and **color ramps**.

GOAT allows users to apply **data-driven styling (attribute-based styling)** techniques to enhance the visual appearance of elements (such as point, lines or polygons) on a map is dynamically changed based on underlying data attributes. This approach allows the visual representation to reflect variations and patterns in the data, making it easier to recognise and understand complex information spatially.
