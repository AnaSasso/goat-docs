# Data Types

GOAT differentiates between four different data types: 

**Feature layer:** Shapefile, Geopackage, GeoJSON, KML etc. allow all analysis (depending on geometry type) and visualisation options.

**Table layer:** Excel or CSV files that can be further processed for certain tools.

**External Imagery Layer:** External WMS services that can be integrated as static maps.

**External Vector Tile Layer:** MVT vector tiles that can be integrated into GOAT as static maps and for which the style can be customised.
